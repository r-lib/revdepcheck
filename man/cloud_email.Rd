\usage{
cloud_email(
  type = c("broken", "failed"),
  job_id = cloud_job(),
  pkg = ".",
  packages = NULL,
  draft = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{type}{Type of problems to notify about; either "broken" (i.e. there
is a new \verb{R CMD check} failure that did not currently occur) or
"failed" (i.e. the check failure either during installation or because
of a timeout).}

\item{job_id}{The batch job_id, as returned by \code{\link[=cloud_check]{cloud_check()}}.}

\item{pkg}{Path to package.}

\item{packages}{A character vector of package names. Use this if some emails
failed to send in the previous round. If omitted uses all packages.}

\item{draft}{If \code{TRUE}, create a gmail draft rather than sending the email
directly.}
}
\description{
This function uses gmail to automatically notify all maintainers of revdeps
that have failures with the new version of the package. The form of the
email is fixed, but it uses template parameters so that you can control
the details: set the variables in \code{revdeps/email.yaml}. You'll be prompted to
review the template before any emails are sent; or you can use
\code{revdep_email_draft()} to see a draft version.
}
\details{
To use this function, you'll need to give the gmailr app authority to
send emails from gmail. To revoke that authority, delete the \code{.httr-oauth}
file created in your working directory.
