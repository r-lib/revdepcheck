\title{Return the current cloud job}
\usage{
cloud_job(job_id = NULL, pkg = ".")
}
\arguments{
\item{job_id}{If not \code{NULL}, sets the active \code{job_id} to the input.}

\item{pkg}{Path to package.}
}
\description{
The \code{job_id} is automatically set by \code{\link[=cloud_check]{cloud_check()}} and is remembered for
the duration of the current R session. If there is no active \code{job_id}, but
there are local cloud check results, \code{job_id} is inferred from the most
recently modified cloud check results.
