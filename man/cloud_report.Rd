\arguments{
\item{job_id}{The batch job_id, as returned by \code{\link[=cloud_check]{cloud_check()}}.}

\item{pkg}{Path to package.}

\item{file}{File to write output to. Default will write to console.}

\item{all}{Whether to report all problems, including the ones that
were already present in the old version of the package. This potentially
generated a lot of output, most of which was irrelevant, so they are
omitted by default, and only problems seen with the new version of
the package are reported.}

\item{results}{Results from \code{\link[=cloud_results]{cloud_results()}}. Expert use only.}

\item{failures}{Save failures to disk?}
}

You can use these functions to get intermediate reports of a running cloud check.
