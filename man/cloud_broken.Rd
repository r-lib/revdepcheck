\arguments{
\item{job_id}{The batch job_id, as returned by \code{\link[=cloud_check]{cloud_check()}}.}

\item{pkg}{Path to package.}

\item{install_failures}{Whether to include packages that failed to install.}

Failed packages are those whose cloud jobs failed, either because the spot
instance was shut down by AWS or because the checks used too much memory and
were killed.
