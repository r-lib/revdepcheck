Dear {your_name},

This is an automated email to let you know that:

* A new version of {my_package}, {my_version}, is ready to go to CRAN.
* {your_package} uses {my_package} and has problems with the new version.
* We plan to submit {my_package} to CRAN on {release_date}.

I need your help to keep {your_package} and {my_package} working together smoothly. In the next {rel_release_date}, can you please:

1. Read about the changes to {my_package} at {my_news_url}.
   This page includes a list of breaking changes, the reasoning behind
   them, and to how to update your code.

2. Carefully inspect the failing checks listed at the bottom of this email.

3. For each failing check, either update your package, or tell me
   that I have a bug. If you have made changes to your package, please
   submit an update to CRAN before {release_date}.

If you have discovered a bug in {my_package}, please file an issue (ideally with a small reprex that illustrates the problem) at {my_issues_url}. If you're not sure whether or not you've found a bug, please an issue and we'll help you figure it out.

Thanks,

{my_name}
