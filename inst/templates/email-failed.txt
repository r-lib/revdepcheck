Dear {your_name},

This is an automated email to let you know that:

* A new version of {my_package} is ready to go to CRAN. {my_package} is
  currently at version {my_version} and will become {release_version} upon release.

* {your_package} uses {my_package}, but I could not automatically check it.

* We plan to submit {my_package} to CRAN on {release_date}.

I need your help to keep {your_package} and {my_package} working together smoothly. In the next {rel_release_date}, can you please run R CMD check on your package using the development version of {my_package}. You can see at list of changes at {my_news_url}.

If you discover any failing checks, either update your package, or inform me that you have found a potential bug in {my_package}.

* If you update your package, please submit an update to CRAN before {release_date}.

* If you have discovered a bug in {my_package}, please file an issue (ideally
  with a small reprex that illustrates the problem) at {my_issues_url}.

* If you're not sure whether or not you've found a bug, please an issue and
  we'll help you figure it out.

Thanks,

{my_name}
